# Unity Responsive UI Showcase  
**Author:** Huda Firdaus  
**Date:** March 2025  

## Overview  

This project demonstrates my skills in building responsive and interactive UI layouts using Unity.  
As part of the project, I recreated a portion of the UI from ***Coral Island*** (by Stairway Games) to showcase accurate layout replication, dynamic responsiveness, and transitions.

## Technology Used  

- **Engine:** Unity 6000.0.29f  
- **Language:** C#  

## Plugin  

- **[DOTween (Demigiant)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dotween-hotween-v2-27676):**  
  Used for animating UI transitions, smooth tweens, and button interactions.

## Key Features  

### ‚ú® Responsive UI Layout  
- Dynamic adjustment to various screen resolutions and aspect ratios.  
- Tested on resolution presets:  
  - 1600 x 900 (16:9)  
  - 1600 x 1000 (16:10)  
  - 1600 x 675 (21:9)  
- Resizable window support to simulate various screen setups.  

### üé® UI Design and Layout  
- Recreated UI screens inspired by ***Coral Island*** using placeholder assets and accurate custom measurements.  
- Focused on clean visual structure, scaling, and proper hierarchy organization within Unity's UI system.  

### üñ±Ô∏è User Interaction and Animations
